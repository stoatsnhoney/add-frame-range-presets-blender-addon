# Add Frame Range Presets Add-On for Blender
A simple Blender add-on that adds a panel to the Output Properties tab. You can create preset frame ranges from this panel and even make automatic presets from existing markers.

This 1.1 version is in Beta. This update features a complete redesign of the menu's interface and fixes the issue where presets would not be saved upon closing Blender.

## Known Issues
You may get an error when installing the add-on. I am still figuring out how to avoid this, but my testing indicates the add-on works properly upon closing and reopening Blender.
